# Bourbon_Collection
This is a simple C# application that reads a csv file and formats the data into a list of bourbon bottles. After reading the file the user is prompted with multiple options which include

View the entire collection
Add a new bottle to the collection
Update an existing bottle in the collection
Delete a bottle from the collection
Calculate the MSRP and secondary values of the collection

The features from the list that I chose to implement include

A master loop
Create a list of several values and use one in my program
Read data from a csv/external file
Use Linq query
