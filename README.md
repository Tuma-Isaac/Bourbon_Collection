# Bourbon_Collection
This is a simple C# application that reads a csv file and formats the data into a list of bourbon bottles. After reading the file the user is prompted with multiple options which include

1.View the entire collection
2.Add a new bottle to the collection
3.Update an existing bottle in the collection
4.Delete a bottle from the collection
5.Calculate the MSRP and secondary values of the collection

The features from the list that I chose to implement include

1.A master loop
2.Create a list of several values and use one in my program
3.Read data from a csv/external file
4.Use Linq query
